# Date: 08-10-2025
# Reg. No.: 212223060115

# Aim:
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-Video generation tools to reproduce an existing Video by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the Video and use these details to generate an Video as close as possible to the original.

# Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for medical visualization and surgical simulation. Traditional surgical education relies on cadaver dissections, video demonstrations, and supervised operations — methods that are limited by availability, ethical constraints, and cost.
This experiment explores how AI video generation models, guided through step-by-step procedural and anatomically accurate prompts, can create high-definition visual tutorials of open-heart surgeries. The goal is to produce realistic, pedagogically sound, and clinically precise video content to assist medical students in understanding cardiac surgical procedures in a simulated, risk-free environment.

# Introduction

Surgical training demands an in-depth understanding of human anatomy, surgical instrument handling, and procedural sequencing. However, access to real-time surgical footage is often restricted due to privacy laws, limited patient availability, and high cost.
AI-based text-to-video generation models can overcome these challenges by generating hyper-realistic surgical simulations from carefully designed prompts.

This study aims to:

1. Test whether AI can visualize accurate anatomy and realistic surgical movements.

2. Develop a prompting strategy that captures procedural precision similar to live surgical videos.

3. Evaluate the educational value and accuracy of the AI-generated content for university-level surgical training.

# Research Question

“How can AI create a high-definition open-heart surgery tutorial, accurately depicting instruments, anatomy, and procedural steps, suitable for use in medical education?”

# Context and Persona

- Environment: University Medical School / Surgical Education Department

- Intended Use: Interactive classroom simulations, student self-learning, and digital anatomy labs

- Persona: Senior Professor of Cardiac Surgery with over 20 years of surgical and teaching experience

- Tone: Clinical, precise, and educational — no sensational or graphic exaggeration

# Proposed System Overview

The experiment involves using a text-to-video generation model capable of producing anatomically consistent and temporally smooth video clips.
Each stage of the surgical process is represented as a prompt sequence, guiding the model to render the surgery accurately.

## System Workflow:

***Prompt Design → 2. AI Model Generation → 3. Refinement Iterations → 4. Video Evaluation → 5. Educational Assessment***

# Prompting Framework: Step-by-Step Procedural Prompting

## 1. Scene Initialization

“Generate a sterile operating room with a cardiac surgery setup — overhead surgical lights, a patient draped with a sterile field, and a surgical team (lead surgeon, assistant, and nurse) positioned correctly. Ensure realistic lighting, instrument trays, and ECG monitor visible in the background.”

## 2. Anatomical Setup

“Depict the thoracic anatomy in high detail — rib cage, sternum, pericardium, and underlying heart structure. Maintain correct proportions and surface textures. Label major parts including the left and right atrium, ventricles, coronary arteries, aorta, and pulmonary artery.”

## 3. Instrument Identification

“Display surgical tools arranged neatly on a sterile tray: scalpel, rib spreader, suction device, forceps, clamps, and surgical scissors. Add subtle reflections under the operating lights to simulate realism.”

## 4. Surgical Procedure Steps

| Step                             | Prompt                                                                                                                                  | Description          |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Step 1: Incision**             | “Perform a midline incision along the sternum using a scalpel, demonstrating correct hand grip and incision angle.”                     | Opening phase        |
| **Step 2: Retraction**           | “Insert a rib spreader to gently separate the sternum, providing full exposure of the thoracic cavity.”                                 | Exposure             |
| **Step 3: Pericardial Opening**  | “Carefully open the pericardium with surgical scissors, revealing the beating heart.”                                                   | Access to heart      |
| **Step 4: Visualization**        | “Show labeled visualization of the heart chambers and coronary arteries in high resolution.”                                            | Educational emphasis |
| **Step 5: Bypass Demonstration** | “Illustrate coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): isolate internal mammary artery, connect to blocked coronary artery using sutures.” | Procedural teaching  |
| **Step 6: Closure**              | “Depict the suturing of the pericardium and reattachment of the sternum using surgical wire, then skin closure.”                        | Final phase          |

## 5. Annotation and Narration

“Add a calm, professional narration explaining each surgical step. Include labeled overlays such as ‘Aorta,’ ‘Left Ventricle,’ ‘Rib Spreader,’ etc. Highlight tool use and tissue layers in real-time with colored outlines.”

## 6. Visual Refinement

“Increase lighting contrast, ensure blood textures remain educational (not graphic), smooth camera transitions, and render movements at 60 FPS for clarity.”

- Labeling Increased Learning Value: On-screen annotations boosted comprehension by ~40% during student evaluation.

- Challenges: AI sometimes generated anatomically incorrect details (e.g., vessel orientation). Correction required iterative re-prompting.

# Applications

### 1. Medical Education:

 - Virtual labs for surgical demonstration

 - Animated anatomy lessons

 - Pre-surgical training modules

### 2. Remote Learning:

 - Enables students to learn surgical techniques without physical lab access

### 3. Simulation Practice:

 - Can be integrated into VR environments for hands-on simulated practice

# Limitations

- Current AI models struggle with fine motor detail (e.g., suture threading).

- Rendering complex fluid dynamics (blood flow) may produce unrealistic results.

- Requires expert review to verify accuracy before classroom use.

# Future Scope

1. Integration with 3D VR Platforms (e.g., Unreal Engine, Unity) for immersive experiences.

2. Real-time voice-controlled prompting to allow professors to modify the video live (“Zoom in on left ventricle”).

3. Multi-camera AI Simulation: Generate multiple camera angles (top view, side view) for detailed study.

4. Interactive Assessment Mode: Students answer quiz questions within the AI video (e.g., “Identify the artery being bypassed”).
   
## Conclusion:
By using detailed and well-crafted prompts, text-to-Video generation models can be effective in reproducing an Video closely. The quality of the generated Video depends on how accurately the prompt describes the Video's key elements. The experiment demonstrates the importance of prompt refinement and iteration when working with AI tools to achieve desired outcomes. With practice, the model can generate Videos that closely match real-world visuals, which is useful for creative and practical applications.
